      <p class="lede">A Grocery Store Garlic Obsession</p>
      <p class="copy">At first you might think that Prof. Patterson was
         kidding. A little commentary about garlic mentioned here.  A little
         anecdote in passing there.  Upon reflection, however, it would become
         clear that the mentions belied a deep set obsession with the odiforous
         bulb.  Making many question whether there was vampire trauma in his
         past.
      </p>
      <p class="other">It was an obsession that would eventually lead to his demise.
